# Recorder-keyboard

This is an ongoing project to create a recorder (the instrument) shaped object that could be used as a mouse keyboard combo.

##Todo:
- Handle mod keys (Control, Shift and Alt)
- Explore using a gyro module to use moving the angle of the "instrument" to move the pointer.
- Create a version with a LiPo battery.
- Create a building guide.
- Add a buzzer to be able to use it as an instrument.
- Create a companion app to translate text into notes.
- Create a web configuration page to change the mapping between notes and keys.
- Create a prettier Readme.
